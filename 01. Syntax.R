# R is a programming language that is interpreted and dynamically typed.
# It is widely used for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical presentation.
# R is a great tool for data science, machine learning, and data visualization.
# It provides a wide range of statistical techniques, such as statistical tests, classification, clustering, and data reduction.
# R is also known for its powerful graphical capabilities, making it easy to create plots like pie charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more.


# You can print text by using single or double quotes:
"Yash Rohan!"  


# Without using print() - In an interactive session, this will automatically display the output
"Hello, World!"  


# Performing simple calculations
15 + 15  # This will automatically display 30 in an interactive session.


# If you want to explicitly print something inside curly braces or an expression,
# you can use the print() function to display the result.
print("Hello, World!")  # Explicitly prints the text "Hello, World!"


# Performing simple arithmetic with print()
print(15 + 15)  # Explicitly prints the result of 15 + 15
